====================== install plugins ==================================================
please add the plugin for your maya version to the correct folder before loading the rig.
in the plugins folder included with this rig you will find folders corresponding to certain maya versions, 
locate the folder with the same version as the maya you will be using

for windows: RigSystem.mll
for OSX: RigSystem.bundle

On Windows, the default plug-in location is: 
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya<version>\bin\plug-ins

On Mac OS X, the default locations are: 
/Applications/Autodesk/maya<version>/Maya.app/Contents/MacOS/plug-ins and 
/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/<version>
(Maya checks both of these locations for valid plug-ins.)

before opening the rig in the scene, these plugins need to be loaded
in maya main menubar go to: windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager
if the plugin is places in the correct folder you can search for RigSystem.mll(.bundle/.os) and it will be listed, if not make sure the plugin is in the correct folder
you can also browse for the plugin using "browse"

the plugin needs to be "Loaded" for it to work, use "Auto load" for the plugin to be automatically loaded next time you start Maya.


now you can open the rig without problem
